				<p>
					When I entered the Engineering Leadership Program almost a year ago, I entered with the goal of pushing my limits, of going beyond what I was usually comfortable with. Boy, was I not disappointed. Over the past year, through countless exercises, simulations, discussions, and case studies, I have watched myself fail in situations far past my comfort zone, only to bounce back stronger. I have been challenged time and time again, and been impressed when I am able to rise to each one.

					I hope that all viewing this portfolio (including myself) can get an idea about what makes me a good leader.

                            <p>One of the first things I learned about myself was my type, or the impression I make on people who I don't know well. My peers determined that I was a charm type; I have the innate ability to make people smile and feel comfortable, much like a koala bear. Knowing my type provides me with the awareness to figure out what kinds of situations I would be most effective leading in. Just by being me in front of a room of people can establish a friendly, happy environment, which can be very useful in certain situations. It also helps me keep in mind my weaknesses in areas where I could ask for help. </p>

                            <p>As a leader, it is important to note where you excel. Knowing your strengths gives you confidence and reinforces your role in certain situations. I have identifies five areas where I feel I rise to the challenge when I am working as a leader:
                            </p>
                            <p>Harmony: I have the ability to search for areas of agreement while in a group. I can mitigate arguments and differences to make a group more effective. Positivity: I am encouraging and generous with praise, which can motivate and energize the group dynamic. Achiever: I am driven to accomplish tasks, and am good at always looking to take the next step forward. Developer: I see the potential in others and take the time to challenge people and help them grow. Analytical: I can be objective and logical, quick to fully think through any point or assertion.
                            </p>

                            <div class="clear"></div>
                            <p>Part of my growth as a leader involved examining ptential derailers that might undermine my leadership. At the top of this list was my inner critic, the voice in my head that, against all logic and reason, puts me down. If not dealt with properly, the inner critic can demotivate me, as well as distract me while leading. Part of dealing with my inner critic involved putting an image to him, which in my case was a giant man watching a TV with my life displayed on it. When thought about this way, I can more easily recognize that my inner critic is always there, and while I can't necessarily get rid of him, I can push aside his comments that get in the way of my leadership.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another obstacle in the way of my leadership is my tendency to procrastinate. I often wait until the last moment before completing projects, against my better judgment. This leads to late nights, and a loss of sleep. In general, the drowsiness and stress that build up are obstacles that I need to avoid in order to be an effective leader. Recognizing the main cause of this problem is an important step to correcting it.

                            <p>Many of the decisions that we make as leaders are in a moral gray area. I will have to make many tough choices in the future, so knowing exactly where I draw the line is extremely important. I reflected on some of the past decisions I have made and what factors led me to thinking they were acceptable, and found some tendencies that did not agree with my ethical code. For instance, I tend to follow the crowd, even if it's against my better judgment. This is a behavior that I will have to monitor in order to follow my ethical code more closely. But I have also found factors that I have decided are good measures of a certain choice, like how my friends would react if they heard about my decision, and how many people my decision would hurt.

                            <p>Even outside of a leadership setting, I've noticed that I've been able to use level 3 listening to establish more of a connection with people. I've learned a lot more my network, how to expand it, and how to use it to my advantage. I've practiced ways to reduce stress that might get in the way of leadership. I've explored the dynamics of distanced teams and what is required in order for them to work cohesively. I've managed "multiple screens" in a leadership setting that represent all a leader has to keep track of during an event. One of the most useful things I've learned is the leadership cycle, of paying attention to the room around me, noticing my own urges and the needs of the room, acting when it seems necessary, and accepting the consequences.

                            <p>Over the past year, I have had to step far outside my comfort zone on multiple occasions. I had no idea what such an undertaking would mean, how successful I would be, or even if I would be able to fully commit to developing myself. But somehow, every time I was tested, I found something within me to keep going. I've stood on my own and gave speeches about my purpose, taken part in many group activities designed to trick and confuse, and partaken in coaching sessions that delved further into my actionas than I ever had before. This is what I associate courage with. Courage requires risk, individualism, and perserverane in the face of adversity. I can only hope that I can continue to maintain my courage as I continue to learn new things about myself.

                            <p>Personally, my goals are to value my friends as much as possible, to always incorporate some enjoyment into every activity, and to become a person that will recognize someone who is struggling and provide the necessary help.

                            <p>Professionally, my goals are still unclear. I want to find a career that provides some selfless service to help people, incorporates logic and puzzles, and where I am surrounded by people I enjoy being around. But specifically, I am still searching for my true calling.

                            <p>Earlier this year, I gave a speech on what I believed my purpose to be. I talked about acts of kindness and how much of an impact we can have when we reach out to other people. Based on this speech, I was assigned to the "compassion" group for our projects.
                            </p>

                            <p>Over the next 8 months, I worked a great deal on this project, and my passion for compassion became clear to me. The impact my team and I was having on people was extraordinary, and truly filled my sense of purpose. This project has affirmed me in pursuing a purpose of spreading compassion in the world.

                        <h3>What Makes a Great Leader?</h3>
                            <p>I used to think that leadership was just a natural ability. Some people had it, and some didn't. If you weren't born a leader, then there's nothing you can do about it. I couldn't have been more wrong. There is an enormous amount of preparation and work that goes into being a leader. Depending on the impact you want to have, truly great leaders can change things about themselves, the environment, the content, and anything else accessible to achieve the goal. And it is a constant effort; you can never stop trying to be a better leaders, or else you will fall behind.

                            <p>This class has showed me what it means to lead consciously, to know what effect you are having, what effect you want to have, and bridge the gap. A truly great leader will be intentional, organized, and inspirational through any means possible. And with the tools this class has given me, with a lot of practice, I may find myself on the road to becoming such a leader. I look forward to continuing to put myself under the microscope and improve my ability to lead and make the difference that I want to make in the world.
